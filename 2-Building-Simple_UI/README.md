# Building a Simple UI

## Introduction
In this lab, you create two layouts for a Tour Guide application: the first layout for the portrait 
orientation and the second one for the landscape orientation. You will also learn how to use qualifiers, 
text views, buttons and how to save the state on orientation change.

## Instructions:
Create the following layouts for a Tour guide application. When a user clicks on a button, the text should 
display some information about that City name that was clicked. Make sure each layout works in the 
correct orientation based on the current orientation of the device. When users change the orientation, 
the layout should change to adjust to the new orientation. Use “savedInstanceState” method to 
preserve the state of the text when the orientation changes.
